# InstrumentAbstractClass
Create an abstract class, called Instrument which will contains a field name and a method called play, that must be implemented by a sub-class. You need to define a sub-class called StringedInstrument that extends the Instrument class and adds an extra field called numberOfStrings. Then you add two more classes "ElectricGuitar and ElectricBassGuitar" that implements the functionality of a StringedIntrument.
